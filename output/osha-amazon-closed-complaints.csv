There is little to no enforcement of 6¿ social distancing. There are 15 people waiting to get in; line backs up. People are going up and down ramp delivering and returning packages, overlapping and next to each other. 410 Terry Avenue N, Seattle 3/31/3030 Amazon is failing to protect its workers (and therefore its customers and everyone else) in many ways, including failing to provide paid sick leave so that sick or compromised workers are more likely to come to work, putting work stations and workers too close together, failing to provide protection such as hand sanitizer, goggles, masks, and gloves, and punishing workers who express concerns and/or have underlying health conditions. Warehouse, 18323 Andover Park West, Seattle 4/1/2020 This is a warehouse where food delivery packages are put together and delivered throughout the entire Seattle area. Over a hundred and fifty people in one small building with no hand sanitizer available nor wipes. Absolutely no enforcement of 6-foot distance. Talked to management several times and they said they don't have time to implement the procedures. One person infected will create havoc for thousands because this is a grocery delivery business. BFI4, 21005 64th Ave S, Kent 3/30/2020 Many workers in places, including management, not allowing for social distancing. No cleaning after positive cases of employees. Whole Foods, 2210 Westlake Ave, Seattle 3/30/2020 Store is not enforcing social distancing between team members. Many use public transit for long distances potentially exposing themselves and others. Buyers sit 2-3 ft. away from each other in the back office for hours. Same for employee training done on computers. Employees are not washing hands or changing gloves. Store leader is allowing 100 customers in the store at one time (not counting the many employees). AMZL Warehouse, 1101 SW 16th , Renton Business is not enforcing social distancing and allowing sick employees to come into work, putting others at risk. Amazon, 2121 7th Avenue, Seattle Building staff remains on site. Often facilities such as the mailroom are fully staffed. This is true for all Amazon buildings and includes janitors, security, and reception. Social distancing guidelines are not possible to follow in many buildings. PPE is not available. Warehouse, Center St, Dupont Amazon staff here are walking around in the way of people working and not following social distancing. Costco and Walmart limit customers for everyone¿s protection but Amazon is not promoting social distancing. Two people were fired for complaining about Amazon's practices. Apparently, Amazon has a firing policy for reporting concerns. Delivery driver, 27th Avenue between Jefferson and Cherry, Seattle on April 24 AM An Amazon delivery truck driver made several deliveries near here with multiple packages not wearing a mask or practicing social distancing. He got close to elderly people potentially exposing them and others from multiple package handling. Didn¿t notice whether gloves were worn. Amazon distribution center, no address listed Workers too close to each other; no social distancing and no masks worn. There was a positive COVID 19 employee working here April 12 and they didn¿t deep clean until April 22. Workers worked in the area the entire time. ",/
